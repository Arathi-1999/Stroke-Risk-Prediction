# Stroke-Risk-Prediction
This was a supervised learning classification type problem. Understood the given dataset and looked through its structure and identify the data types of various columns. Check for Nan data, duplicate data and convert certain columns to required data types.Then applied some ML algorithms which were Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN Classifier, Random Forest and SVM and evaluated the model with the help of Accuracy score.

# Steps to be performed:
# 1. Loading the dataset
# 2. Perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
# 3. Fill Null values
# 4. Outlier Removation
# 5. Label Encoding
# 6. Splitting the data into train and test
# 7. Normalization
# 8. Model Selection - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, SVM .
